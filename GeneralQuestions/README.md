    <p>
MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.

**Model** - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.

**View** - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.

**Controller** - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.

        Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.
